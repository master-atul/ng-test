# ng-test
A test library for NodeGUI widgets

### Development
The recommended way of getting started with contributing is using [Docker](https://docker.com)

> If you already have Qt5 installed locally and don't want use [Docker](https://docker.com), go over to the [Docker image for Qode](https://github.com/ng-qt/qode-docker-image) and set the same environment variables in your own system.

Run the following command below to execute AND/OR run the NG-Test development environment for [Docker](https://docker.com)
```
./docker-dev.sh
```

#### Requirements
* [Docker](https://docker.com)
* [Qt5](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qt5-intro.html)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
